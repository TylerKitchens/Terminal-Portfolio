# Old School Terminal Portfolio

This project showcases my unique approach to a portfolio. I was tired of seeing countless word press installs and pre-made bootstrap portfolio templates. I wanted something that was both unique, and fun to make.

This project was build using React. I did not spend a lot of time architecture it or using industry best practices due to a project deadline for college. Nonetheless, it was something fun to build and I hope you get a kick out of it.

Feel free to download the source code and make it your own. You do not need to give me credit, all I ask is you submit a PR with some cool new feature in return! Happy Hacking!
